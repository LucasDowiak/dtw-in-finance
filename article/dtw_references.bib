  abstract = {Mining sequential data is an old topic that has been revived in the last decade, due to the increasing availability of sequential datasets. Most works in this field are centred on the definition and use of a distance (or, at least, a similarity measure) between sequences of elements. A measure called dynamic time warping (DTW) seems to be currently the most relevant for a large panel of applications. This article is about the use of DTW in data mining algorithms, and focuses on the computation of an average of a set of sequences. Averaging is an essential tool for the analysis of data. For example, the K-means clustering algorithm repeatedly computes such an average, and needs to provide a description of the clusters it forms. Averaging is here a crucial step, which must be sound in order to make algorithms work accurately. When dealing with sequences, especially when sequences are compared with DTW, averaging is not a trivial task. Starting with existing techniques developed around DTW, the article suggests an analysis framework to classify averaging techniques. It then proceeds to study the two major questions lifted by the framework. First, we develop a global technique for averaging a set of sequences. This technique is original in that it avoids using iterative pairwise averaging. It is thus insensitive to ordering effects. Second, we describe a new strategy to reduce the length of the resulting average sequence. This has a favourable impact on performance, but also on the relevance of the results. Both aspects are evaluated on standard datasets, and the evaluation shows that they compare favourably with existing methods. The article ends by describing the use of averaging in clustering. The last section also introduces a new application domain, namely the analysis of satellite image time series, where data mining techniques provide an original approach.}

	year = {2016},
	abstract = {A concerted research effort over the past two decades has heralded significant improvements in both the efficiency and effectiveness of time series classification. The consensus that has emerged in the community is that the best solution is a surprisingly simple one. In virtually all domains, the most accurate classifier is the nearest neighbor algorithm with dynamic time warping as the distance measure. The time complexity of dynamic time warping means that successful deployments on resource-constrained devices remain elusive. Moreover, the recent explosion of interest in wearable computing devices, which typically have limited computational resources, has greatly increased the need for very efficient classification algorithms. A classic technique to obtain the benefits of the nearest neighbor algorithm, without inheriting its undesirable time and space complexity, is to use the nearest centroid algorithm. Unfortunately, the unique properties of (most) time series data mean that the centroid typically does not resemble any of the instances, an unintuitive and underappreciated fact. In this paper we demonstrate that we can exploit a recent result by Petitjean et al. to allow meaningful averaging of ``warped''time series, which then allows us to create super-efficient nearest ``centroid''classifiers that are at least as accurate as their more computationally challenged nearest neighbor relatives. We demonstrate empirically the utility of our approach by comparing it to all the appropriate strawmen algorithms on the ubiquitous UCR Benchmarks and with a case study in supporting insect classification on resource-constrained sensors.},

In the empirical process, firstly, we subdivide the analysis period from June 2005 to May 2011 into three sub-periods: before, during, and after the US sub-prime crisis. Secondly, we choose NZD (New Zealand dollar) as the numeraire and then, analyze the topology evolution of FX markets in terms of the structure changes of MSTs during the above periods. We also present the hierarchical tree associated with the MST to study the currency clusters in each sub-period. Our results confirm that USD and EUR are the predominant world currencies. But USD gradually loses the most central position while EUR acts as a stable center in the MST passing through the crisis. Furthermore, an interesting finding is that, after the crisis, SGD (Singapore dollar) becomes a new center currency for the network.}

abstract = {An important theoretical topic in assistive environments is reasoning about temporal patterns, that represent the sequential output of various sensors, and that can give us information about the health and activities of humans and the state of the environment. The recent growth in the quantity and quality of sensors for assistive environments has made it possible to create large databases of temporal patterns, that store sequences of observations obtained from such sensors over large time intervals. A topic of significant interest is being able to search such large databases so as to identify content of interest, for example activities of a certain type, or information about a patient's well-being. In this paper, we study two different approaches for conducting such searches: an exemplar-based approach, where we describe what we are looking for by giving an example, and a model-based approach, where we describe what we are looking for via a generative model. In particular, we describe the two different approaches, and we identify some important pros and cons for each approach. We also perform a comparative evaluation of exemplar-based search using dynamic time warping (DTW), and model-based search using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), on large real datasets. In our experiments, when the number of training objects per model is sufficiently high, model-based search using HMMs produces more accurate search results than exemplar-based search using DTW.},

@article{KeoghRatanamahatana_2005,
	Abstract = {The problem of indexing time series has attracted much interest. Most algorithms used to index time series utilize the Euclidean distance or some variation thereof. However, it has been forcefully shown that the Euclidean distance is a very brittle distance measure. Dynamic time warping (DTW) is a much more robust distance measure for time series, allowing similar shapes to match even if they are out of phase in the time axis. Because of this flexibility, DTW is widely used in science, medicine, industry and finance. Unfortunately, however, DTW does not obey the triangular inequality and thus has resisted attempts at exact indexing. Instead, many researchers have introduced approximate indexing techniques or abandoned the idea of indexing and concentrated on speeding up sequential searches. In this work, we introduce a novel technique for the exact indexing of DTW. We prove that our method guarantees no false dismissals and we demonstrate its vast superiority over all competing approaches in the largest and most comprehensive set of time series indexing experiments ever undertaken.},

  abstract = {Dynamic time warping (DTW), which finds the minimum path by providing non-linear alignments between two time series, has been widely used as a distance measure for time series classification and clustering. However, DTW does not account for the relative importance regarding the phase difference between a reference point and a testing point. This may lead to misclassification especially in applications where the shape similarity between two sequences is a major consideration for an accurate recognition. Therefore, we propose a novel distance measure, called a weighted DTW (WDTW), which is a penalty-based DTW. Our approach penalizes points with higher phase difference between a reference point and a testing point in order to prevent minimum distance distortion caused by outliers. The rationale underlying the proposed distance measure is demonstrated with some illustrative examples. A new weight function, called the modified logistic weight function (MLWF), is also proposed to systematically assign weights as a function of the phase difference between a reference point and a testing point. By applying different weights to adjacent points, the proposed algorithm can enhance the detection of similarity between two time series. We show that some popular distance measures such as DTW and Euclidean distance are special cases of our proposed WDTW measure. We extend the proposed idea to other variants of DTW such as derivative dynamic time warping (DDTW) and propose the weighted version of DDTW. We have compared the performances of our proposed procedures with other popular approaches using public data sets available through the UCR Time Series Data Mining Archive for both time series classification and clustering problems. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approaches can achieve improved accuracy for time series classification and clustering problems.}

A first-order logic representation is chosen to describe the shape and corresponding constraints of each pattern. These formal specifications are formulated in such a way that data mining algorithms can use them for classification without significant modification. These formal specifications are also intended to serve as a reference model for future research in the chart patterns classification area. Using these formal specifications, we perform extensive experiments using real datasets from NYSE Composite (NYSE), Hang Seng Index (HSI), and Amazon (AMZN). The performance of the proposed method is compared against Template Based (TB), Euclidean Distance (ED), and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) approaches. The experimental results show that the rules translated from the specifications can be effectively used to identify chart patterns from real datasets.}

  abstract={Network representations are powerful tools to modeling the dynamic time-varying financial complex systems consisting of multiple co-evolving financial time series, e.g., stock prices. In this work, we develop a novel framework to compute the kernel-based similarity measure between dynamic time-varying financial networks. Specifically, we explore whether the proposed kernel can be employed to understand the structural evolution of the financial networks with time associated with standard kernel machines. For a set of time-varying financial networks with each vertex representing the individual time series of a different stock and each edge between a pair of time series representing the absolute value of their Pearson correlation, our start point is to compute the commute time (CT) matrix associated with the weighted adjacency matrix of the network structures, where each element of the matrix can be seen as the enhanced correlation value between pairwise stocks. For each network, we show how the CT matrix allows us to identify a reliable set of dominant correlated time series as well as an associated dominant probability distribution of the stock belonging to this set. Furthermore, we represent each original network as a discrete dominant Shannon entropy time series computed from the dominant probability distribution. With the dominant entropy time series for each pair of financial networks to hand, we develop an entropic dynamic time warping kernels through the classical dynamic time warping framework, for analyzing the financial time-varying networks. We show that the proposed kernel bridges the gap between graph kernels and the classical dynamic time warping framework for multiple financial time series analysis. Experiments on time-varying networks extracted through New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) database demonstrate that the effectiveness of the proposed method.}}

  abstract = {Methods for crop phenology detection using time series analysis have provided accurate information for large agricultural areas in shorter processing times, which can be useful for agronomic management and supply chain monitoring. Given the crop dynamics in the Brazilian Cerrado, with alternating crop type plantings, crop successions, and crop rotations, as well as climate and crop practices variation between harvest periods, these methods can be useful for detecting subtle land use and land cover changes at farm and crop field scales, improving thematic classifications and the near real-time crop monitoring. In this study, the Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping method was applied to recognize patterns in Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series for land use and cover classification, identifying crop successions and rotations at crop field level in a large-scale agro-industrial agglomerate of farms located at Brazilian Cerrado. We detected and analyzed temporal cropping patterns in training samples to classify the MODIS time series and images, using a robust ground truth data set for validation. The method distinguished Cotton-fallow, Soybean-cotton, Soybean-maize, and Soybean-millet cropping patterns with an overall accuracy above 85\% for all evaluated harvest periods. Seasonal variations in the crop fields, caused by interannual succession and rotation, were detected. The method demonstrated the benefit of creating a spatial vector data set for supporting decision-making in several crop management contexts, improving crop and supply chain monitoring.}

  abstract = {Reliable crop type classification supports the scientific basis for food security and sustainable agricultural development. However, it still lacks a limited-samples-based crop classification method which is labor- and time-efficient. To this end, we used the Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Sentinel-1A/B SAR time series to develop eight types of crop classification strategies based on different sampling methods of central and scattered, different perspectives of object-based and pixel-based, and different classifiers of the Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping (TWDTW) and Random Forest (RF). We carried out 30-times classifications with different samples for each strategy to classify the crop types at the North DakotaâMinnesota border in the U.S. We then compared their classification accuracies and assessed the accuracy sensitivity to sample size. The results found that the TWDTW generally performed better than RF, especially for small-sample classification. Object-based classifications had higher accuracies than pixel-based classifications, and the object-based TWDTW had the highest accuracy. RF performed better in scattered sampling than the central sampling strategy. TWDTW performed better than RF in distinguishing soybean and dry bean with similar curves. The accuracies improved for all eight classification strategies with increasing sample size, and TWDTW was more robust, while RF was more sensitive to sample size change. RF required many more samples than TWDTW to achieve satisfactory accuracy, and it performed better than TWDTW when the sample size exceeded 50. The accuracy comparisons indicated that the TWDTW has stronger temporal and spatial generalization capabilities and has high potential applications for early, historical, and limited-samples-based crop type classification. The findings of our research are worthwhile contributions to the methodology and practices of crop type classification as well as sustainable agricultural development.},

abstract = {Monitoring and management of agricultural lands are essential due to reasons affecting agriculture, such as increasing population and global climate. With the increase in the temporal resolution of satellite systems, time-series classifications have become popular in cropland mapping. Because annual plants can give similar spectral reflectance values on the same date. In this context, agricultural land was selected in the south of South Dakota in the United States. The area includes alfalfa, corn, soybeans, winter wheat plants, developed, grassland/pasture, herbaceous wetlands, and open water areas. The study aims to map croplands with vegetation indices produced by annual Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites. In this context, Radar Vegetation Index (RVI) produced from 25 Sentinel-1, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) produced from 26 Sentinel-2 satellites were used for 2020. We used the Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping (TWDTW) algorithm, which separates and classifies the similarities between two time series with variable speeds with time constraints. For mapping, the indices were classified both individually and combined. The highest overall accuracy (77.2\%) was obtained with the combined use of NDVI and RVI. Among the plant classes, the lowest accuracy (83.71\%) was found, and it was determined that the plant classes did not mix much. Sentinel-2 satellite is not available before April due to weather conditions in the region. For this reason, since the Sentinel-1 satellite is not affected by weather conditions, it is thought that the use of two satellites together will be beneficial in time series analysis.},

In the literature, following different methodological approaches, several clustering methods have been proposed for clustering multivariate time series. In this paper by adopting a fuzzy approach and using the Partitioning Around Medoids strategy, we suggest to cluster multivariate financial time series by considering the dynamic time warping distance. In particular, we proposed a robust clustering method capable to neutralize the negative effects of possible outliers in the clustering process. The clustering method achieves its robustness by adopting a suitable trimming procedure to identify multivariate financial time series more distant from the bulk of data. The proposed clustering method is applied to the stocks composing the FTSE MIB index to identify common time patterns and possible outliers.},

DTW has been employed for classification and clustering aims in many fields, but in this paper we make a slightly different application of DTW with respect to those provided by the literature, demonstrating how DTW can be employed also to investigate the decoupling between the two oil benchmarks. Our analysis reveals that the two oil benchmarks decouple and recouple according to WTI local market conditions. Therefore, we found evidence that WTI-Brent market is not fully integrated at all times. We also propose two DTW-based indexes: Relative-Alignment Index (RAI) and Warping Index. The first confirms that the greatest decoupling between WTI and Brent occurs because of WTI local market conditions and is useful in highlighting the main decoupling between our crude oil series over time, while the second provides information on the time window of crude oil price decoupling. Lastly, we provide some policy implications based on our results.}

  title  = {Predicting US Recessions: A Dynamic Time Warping Exercise in Economics},
  abstract = {Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is a widely used algorithm in speech recognition for measuring similarity between two time series. This non-parametric technique overcomes the problems associated with Pearson's correlation coefficient by allowing a non-linear mapping of one sequence to another obtained through the minimization of the distance between the two. Despite its superiority as a similarity measure, its application in the field of economics is almost non-existent. This paper seeks to fill this gap in the economics literature by providing a self-contained description of the method. In addition, it demonstrates an application of DTW to the prediction of recessions in US using Treasury term spread data. The exercise shows that DTW is successful in predicting the recessions of both 1999 and 2007. The predictions are stronger when asymmetric step-pattern is adopted. Also, compared to other non-parametric methods, DTW raises significantly fewer false signals of recessions. Finally, DTW concludes that given the current state of the economy there is a zero probability of a recession in the next one year. },

  abstract = { We exploit ideas from high-dimensional data analysis to derive new portmanteau tests that are based on the trace of the square of the mth order autocorrelation matrix. The resulting statistics are weighted sums of the squares of the sample autocorrelation coefficients that, unlike many other tests appearing in the literature, are numerically stable even when the number of lags considered is relatively close to the sample size. The statistics behave asymptotically as a linear combination of chi-squared random variables and their asymptotic distribution can be approximated by a gamma distribution. The proposed tests are modified to check for nonlinearity and to check the adequacy of a fitted nonlinear model. Simulation evidence indicates that the proposed goodness of fit tests tend to have higher power than other tests appearing in the literature, particularly in detecting long-memory nonlinear models. The efficacy of the proposed methods is demonstrated by investigating nonlinear effects in Apple, Inc., and Nikkei-300 daily returns during the 2006â2007 calendar years.
